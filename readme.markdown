# Advent of Code 2017 

I'm going to try to get through as much of [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Though if I get frustrated with Rust enough I might move to Ruby. 

Here's [a blog post](https://sts10.github.io/2017/11/18/trying-go-and-rust.html) I wrote about my first steps into Rust (warning: that was just a few weeks ago).
